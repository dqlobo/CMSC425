##A. Required elements
 My game follows the following instructions, which I quote from the Piazza post:
      - Use either the arrow keys or "WASD" to tilt the board
           - Maneuver the ball into the [navy blue] circle to win
	        - Hit 'Q' or ESC to quit
		     - Hit 'R' to restart
		          - I allow a maximum tilt of [15] degrees

------------------------------------------------------------------------
##B. Additional elements

I added the pretty wood texture and messed around with the particle generator! I also did this without referencing the "Tilt Maze" tutorial.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
##C. Known issues

Sometimes, if you catch the ground at a strange angle, the ball can burst through. (This could be a problem with collision detection and speed in Unity, as discussed in lecture.) I have accommodated to this problem by reducing the speed/depth of the tilt. I also played around with making the ground a bouncy material; This made the game more fun, but increased occurrences of the bug.
